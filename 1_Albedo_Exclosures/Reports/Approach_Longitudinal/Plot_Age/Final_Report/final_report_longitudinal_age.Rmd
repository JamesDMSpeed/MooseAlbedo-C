# Overview
This report contains a summary of the 'age-based' longitudinal analysis, which uses multi-year SustHerb tree data and the 'age-based' albedo model developed by [Hu et al. (2018)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018MS001403) to examine albedo at relevant study plots across several years. The report covers each step of the analysis and discusses potential limitations/assumptions associated with each step.

# Data

### Data Selection {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

#### SustHerb Data
I chose to use data from SustHerb sites in Trøndelag, Telemark, and Hedmark **(n = 37)**. It is important to note that the following SustHerb sites are missing from my analysis (as they were missing from the analysis conducted by [Snøan (2019)](https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/2618099?locale-attribute=no) and therefore, don't have existing LiDAR data):

* **Hedmark**: "DD1", "DD2", "JCD1", "JCD2", "M1.1", "M1.2", "M2.1", "M2.2", "M3.1", "M3.2", "OIA1", "OIA2", "OL1", "OL2", "SK1", "SK2"
* **Telemark**: "Notodden 1 B", "Notodden 1 UB", "Notodden 4 B", "Notodden 4 UB"

I chose to exclude these sites in order to maintain consistency with other approaches.

#### seNorge Climate Data
The albedo model developed by [Hu et al. (2018)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018MS001403) accepts *two climate parameters*: (1) monthly average snow-water equivalent (mm) and (2) monthly average temperature (K). seNorge provides this data across the entire country of Norway in the form of spatially-gridded daily estimates with a 1km2 resolution. Thus, it was possible to use obtain relevant time series data for each study site used in this approach.

For each study site, I pulled snow-water equivalent and temperature data from each year where tree data for that site existed - so, for example, if a study site had tree data for 2013, 2014, and 2015, I pulled corresponding seNorge data for those years. Monthly averages of temperature (C) and snow-water equivalent (mm) were calculated from each time series. Temperature was converted to K for use with the albedo model.

#### Productivity Index
Site productivity is likely an important variable to control for when attempting to determine the effect of moose exclusion on forest surface albedo. Therefore, I decided to include data from the site productivity index that was developed by [Kolstad et al. (2017)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10021-017-0202-4). This index is based upon a standardized value for mean annual increment in aboveground biomass. 

#### Herbivore Densities
Densities of various herbivores may have important effects on vegetation states within forest ecosystems, and therefore, it is likely relevant to control for relevant herbivore densities in our final analysis. In addition to moose, both red deer and roe deer are important herbivores in Norwegian boreal forests. Thus, I decided to include densities of moose, red deer, and roe deer in the final model for this approach.

[Speed et al. (2019)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0217166) and [Austrheim et al. (2011)](https://bioone.org/journals/Wildlife-Biology/volume-17/issue-3/10-038/Spatio-temporal-variation-in-large-herbivore-pressure-in-Norway-during/10.2981/10-038.full) calculated metabolic biomass (kg/km2) of many different large herbivores in each Norwegian municipality (for 1949, 1959, 1969, 1979, 1989, 1999, 2009, and 2015), which allows us to include herbivore densities as covariates in our final model.

For simplicity's sake, I decided to use herbivore data from 2015 for all SustHerb sites in this approach. However, some sites have LiDAR data closer to 2009 than to 2015 (ex. "namdalseid_1kub" has LiDAR data from 2010). It might be worth it to re-do the analysis and grab herbivore densities from the year closest to that of the LiDAR data for each site. I could then include "herbivore data year" as a categorical variable in the final model, if necessary.

> What is your opinion of using 2015 data for all sites? Should I re-do the analysis as described above?

#Albedo Estimates {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

## Reasoning
I used the forest **age-based version of the albedo model** developed by [Hu et al. (2018)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018MS001403) together with snow-water equivalent and temperature data from [seNorge](http://www.senorge.no/) (described earlier) to produce plot-level albedo estimates for the years corresponding with those in which LiDAR measurements were recorded for each plot (i.e. the "age" value for each plot was set to be the number of years between initial clearcut and LiDAR measurement). **I chose this to allow for direct comparison of albedo estimates from this approach with those from Approaches 2 and 3.**

The albedo model produces monthly estimates for spruce, pine, and birch forest (which encompasses all other deciduous species). I decided that it might be useful to create a **composite albedo** value for each plot (for each month), which would allow for simple comparison of albedos at the plot level. For a given plot in a given month, the first step in creating a composite albedo value is to multiply each species-specific albedo value (produced by the model) with the corresponding species proportions for the plot. This produces three 'fractional albedo' values, which are then summed to produce a 'composite albedo' value:

$$C_{ij} = (A_{ij}S_{jk}) + (A_{ij}S_{jk}) + (A_{ij}S_{jk})\\\;\\C=composite\;albedo\\A = species\mbox{-}specific\;albedo\\S = species\;proportion\\i = month\;(1\mbox{-}12);\;j = plot;\;k = species\;(spruce,\;pine,\;birch)$$

> What do you think about this 'composite albedo'? Is it a reasonable way of assessing albedo across plots?

## Method
1. For a given plot, I ran a function to produce 12 albedo estimates (one for each month of the year)
    + This function incorporated the age of the plot (i.e. number of years between clearcut and LiDAR measurement), as well as 12 values for both average snow-water equivalent (mm) and temperature (K). Snow-water equivalent and temperature data were produced from the year corresponding to that in which the LiDAR measurements of the plot were obtained. The function used the albedo model form described earlier with species-specific coefficients to produce species-specific albedo estimates for each month of a single year.
    + The function then used the relative proportion of spruce, pine, and birch trees to calculate composite albedos (as described in the reasoning section).
2. For each plot, the function produced a total of *12 composite albedo estimates* (one for each month of the year). Thus, the final albedo dataset contains **888 albedo estimates** (12 per plot, 444 per treatment).

#Model {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

## Correlation Matrix
I created a correlation matrix to investigate possible correlations between continuous explanatory variables (which would ultimately affect the stability of the final model). It appears that *Roe Deer Density* is moderately correlated with moose density, but I'm not sure if this correlation is strong enough to warrant removal from the final model.

```{r echo = FALSE, eval= TRUE, message = FALSE}

        ggpairs(data = model_data, columns = c(8:13)) 

```


## Model
Due to the setup of the study design and non-independence of data within each study site (i.e. 2 plots per study site, not independent of each other), I believe we'll need to use a **linear mixed effects model** to model estimated albedo as a function of treatment (moose exclusion). I gave a "first attempt" at a model below - this model was implemented via the *lme4* package in R w/ *lmer* function). I specified the "LocalityName" variable as a random intercept, in order to account for non-independence of data at the level of the study site. The main fixed effect of interest (treatment) was then specified as an interaction with month. 

To select a 'best' model, I started off with a base model with all of the variables of interest (as well as 2-way interaction terms), and then created a 'filtered' model by eliminating terms that weren't significant. I also created a 'simple' model, which only included variables that I thought would be most relevant. I then used the *AIC function* to calculate AIC values for each model. Finally, I chose the model with the lowest AIC value as the 'best' (below).

**Note:** Age/clearcut to lidar is not included, as this data was used to produce albedo estimates

```{r echo = FALSE, eval= TRUE, message = FALSE}

        #Format columns
        model_data$Month <- as.factor(model_data$Month)
        model_data$Treatment <- as.factor(model_data$Treatment)
        model_data$LocalityCode <- as.factor(model_data$LocalityCode)
        model_data$LocalityName <- as.factor(model_data$LocalityName)
        
        #Relevel factors to use 'browsed' as the control/reference
        model_data$Treatment <- relevel(model_data$Treatment, ref = "open")

```

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#Initial model:
lmer(Composite_Albedo ~
               Treatment*Month +
               Clearcut_Lidar +
               Moose_Density +
               Canopy_Height_MAD +
               (1 | LocalityName),
        data = model_data)
```

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
        
#Output
model <- lmer(Composite_Albedo ~
                     Treatment*Month + 
                     Productivity_Index +
                     Canopy_Height_MAD +
                     Moose_Density +
                     (1 | LocalityName),
             data = model_data)
        
tab_model(model, digits = 5)

```

> Is this model correctly specified? Should I be using a non-linear mixed effects model (nlme) instead?

## Diagnosis
It certainly looks like something strange is happening with the residuals. Not sure why there is this linear trend at lower fitted values:

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}

#Output
plot(model)
        
```

***

# Next Steps?

#### Better Model Selection
After looking at the **residuals plot** for the model in the previous section, I'm not convinced that I'm using the correct model. It's clear that the amount of variation in albedo estimates varies substantially by month (ex. the variation in albedo is much greater in December than in July). Do I need to set a specific 'covariance structure' to account for this?

Also, I'm a bit confused about specifying "Month" as a fixed effect vs random effect. We're interested in seeing how treatment (moose exclusion) affects albedo for each month - therefore, it's necessary to add "Month" as a fixed effect together with treatment. However, would it be relevant to add "Month" as a random effect as well/instead? For a given plot, the data from Month 1 will likely be more similar to data from Month 2 than data from Month 8 (i.e. there is non-independence in data across months). How do we handle this?
