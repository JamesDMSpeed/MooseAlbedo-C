## Tentative Project Title:
How do moose influence climate? The effect of moose browsing on albedo and radiative forcing in successional boreal forest.
<br><br><br>
## Project Components:

### Question 1: What is the impact of moose exclosure on surface albedo in Norwegian successional boreal forest?

**Hypothesis**:
> Moose exclosure will increase surface albedo in successional boreal forest, due to greater presence of reflective deciduous trees and less canopy-masking of snow during winter months.

<br><br>
### Question 2: What is the impact of moose exclosure on long-term predictions of radiative forcing in Norwegian successional boreal forest?

**Hypothesis**:
> Moose exclosure will decrease radiative forcing in successional boreal forest, due to predicted increases in albedo and greater deciduous biomass (i.e. carbon storage).

<br><br>
### Question 3: What is the regional impact of moose browsing on surface albedo in Norwegian successional boreal forest?

**Hypothesis**:
> Need to develop a hypothesis here.
