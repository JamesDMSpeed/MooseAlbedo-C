## Project Title:
How do moose influence climate? The effect of moose browsing on surface albedo in successional Norwegian boreal forest.
<br/><br/>
## Question 1:
### Does moose exclosure affect estimated surface albedo in successional Norwegian boreal forest?

**Summary**:
This component of the project is aimed at determining whether moose exclusion has an impact on surface albedo in Norwegian successional boreal forests. It uses four approaches to model the effects of moose exclosure on albedo:
1. The **first approach** involves using Norwegian NFI allometric models to calculate volume for trees in each SustHerb subplot, which is then summed and combined with SWE + Temperature data in an albedo model
2. The **second approach** involves using LiDAR data (from Ingrid Sn√∏an's master's project) to calculate invidual tree-crown volume for all trees in a given LiDAR footprint, using that summed volume in an albedo model, and then using subplot species proportions to calculate a composite albedo value.
3. The **third approach** involves using the same approach as #2, except that plot volume is obtained by summing the volumes of all pixels produced by the plot canopy height model
4. The **fourth approach** uses an 'age-based' variant of the albedo model (which accepts stand age instead of plot volume as a parameter). Tree species proportions are then used to calculate composite albedo values, as in Approaches 2 & 3.

This component of the project also includes a **longitudinal** analysis of albedo in moose exclosures and open plots. It uses the albedo model developed by Cherubini et al., but will be focused on how moose exclosure affects albedo across successional stages (i.e. years since clearcut):
1. **Age-based analysis** - this component of the longitudinal analysis uses the 'age-based' variant of the albedo model to calculate monthly albedo for each plot across all years since clearcut
2. **Volume-based analysis** - this component of the analysis uses the 'volume-based' variant of the albedo model in tandem with the methods used in 'Approach 1' to calculate albedo across all years since clearcut.

## Question 2:
### How does moose browsing affect surface albedo in successional Norwegian boreal forest on a regional scale?

**Summary**:
This component of the project seeks to examine the relationship between albedo and moose density in Norwegian successional boreal forests. It uses a forest data product from the NFI (SatSkog), spatial gridded climate data from SeNorge, elevation models from the Norwegian Mapping Authority, and spatial herbivore density data from previous SustHerb work to model albedo as a function of moose density.
